# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cardiac Risk Factors

This project presents a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of cardiac risk factors to identify key insights into what may contribute to cardiovascular issues. The objective is to analyze patterns and correlations among lifestyle, medical history, and demographic data to support early risk detection and potential intervention strategies.

---

## 📊 Objective

To perform in-depth EDA on health-related features such as:

- Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Inactivity  
- BMI and Obesity
- Hypertension and Diabetes
- Gender, Age group, and Race

The goal is to visualize and quantify how these factors may influence cardiac health risk.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **Plotly** – Interactive charts  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains anonymized survey-based health data on individual cardiac health status and associated lifestyle/demographic risk factors.

**Note:** You may replace this with a public dataset if you wish to share it openly.

---

## 📈 Key Insights Derived

- A strong correlation was found between lack of physical activity and high BMI with heart disease.
- Smoking and Alcohol consumption were more frequent among individuals with heart disease.
- Age and gender played significant roles in the risk distribution across the population.
- Interactive histograms and pair plots provided better visual interpretation of health trends.

## 📌 What You’ll Learn

- How to clean and prepare health data for analysis  
- How to identify missing values and outliers  
- How to create and interpret statistical plots  
- How to draw data-driven health conclusions from EDA

---

## 🧠 Future Scope

- Integrate ML models to predict cardiac risk based on features  
- Add clustering (K-means, PCA) for unsupervised pattern discovery  
- Build a dashboard using Streamlit for interactive public exploration
